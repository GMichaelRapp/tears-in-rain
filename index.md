## 0. Tears In Rain
New societies and new forms of humanity, once unimagined in the Old Place, rise, fall, and rise again. Humanity continually spreads across the vastness of the galaxy, limited only by slow-moving, subluminal travel. As humanity spreads out from the Old Place, new nodes of a galactic communications network are built, laying down the roots for a truly galaxy-spanning civilization. While the stars appear to be ours for the taking, these same stars hold grim reminders of the fates of advanced intelligent life in the universe: We've found only remnants of life, fossils, graveyards, ruins. This hasn't stopped our advances into the universe, nor have these grim reminders halted our search for other sophonts. But some wonder if our galactic expansion and our search for intelligent life will be nothing more than tears in rain, ephemeral moments lost forever, futile attempts to push against one's fate. 

**In this future, a future full of new challenges and new opportunities, the universe is ours, for now . . . Explore. Adapt. Survive. Transcend.

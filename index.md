## Tears In Rain
Amidst the planets, moons, asteroids, and comets humans now call home, humanity is changing, adapting to its new surroundings, its new conditions, and becoming infinitely more alien than its original selves. Humans are continually spreading across the galaxy just a few clicks beneath luminal speeds, colonizing new places, and leaving behind nodes for a galactic communications network, called the Sprawl. New societies and new forms of humanity, once unimagined in the Old Place, rise, fall, and rise again. While the stars may be ours now, they hold a grim reminder of the fragility of intelligent life in the universe. We’ve only managed to find the fossils, ruins, and graveyards of aliens and alien societies. This hasn’t hampered our search for new _intelligent_ life, but it certainly serves as a reminder that we may be next. In this future, new challenges and new opportunities can be found everywhere.

**The universe is yours for the taking . . .  Explore. Adapt. Survive. Transcend.**

- **10 July 2022:** Working on expanding the rules to be player-centric in their approach to gameplay. The Referee (REF) is less active in determining the direction of storyline, plots, etc., in order to allow their players to be active participants, from the get-go. 
- **10 July 2022:** Have put the finishing touches on **wounds** and **sanity**, which are designed to prevent the current problems of Hit Point Mountains, forever combat, and murder hobos. Wounds for an average character are between five (5) and six (6) wounds, with standard weapons dealing 1â€“5 points of damage.

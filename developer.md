- **10 July 2022:** Have begun working on revamping the core files for the GitHub alpha. Hoping to get those up and going soon. In other news, it looks like this thing might lift off the ground in mid-August, if all goes well.
- **10 July 2022:** Working on expanding the rules to be player-centric in their approach to gameplay. The Referee (REF) is less active in determining the direction of storyline, plots, etc., in order to allow their players to be active participants, from the get-go. This, essentially, makes **Tears In Rain** a sandbox TTRPG, with this meaning open decision-making and open-ended worlds/universes as part of the game experience. 
- **10 July 2022:** Have put the finishing touches on **wounds** and **sanity**, which are designed to prevent the current problems of Hit Point Mountains, forever combat, and murder hobos. Wounds for an average character are between five (5) and six (6) wounds, with standard weapons dealing 1â€“5 points of damage.

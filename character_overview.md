## 6. Character Creation (Overview)

### 6.1.	 ROLL 3D6 FOR EACH ATTRIBUTE
**Tears In Rain** uses three (3) six-sided dice, or 3d6, for nearly everything, so be sure to grab a pile of six-sided dice and start rolling your baseline attributes in the following order: BRAWN (BRN), AGILITY (AGL), STAMINA (STA), INTELLECT (INT), and MOXIE (MOX). Stat averages are between nine (9) and twelve (12). You are allowed to swap two scores, and nothing more without further Referee (REF) approval. 

> Read more on attributes and generating attributes on p. 2.1

### 6.2. CHOOSE YOUR FRAME

### 6.3. ROLL 3D6 FOR SOCIAL CLASS 
After rolling your character’s attributes and starting frame, you will then roll 3d6 for your character’s social class. Social class provides several roleplaying and gaming opportunities. 

> Reference Social Class Table, p. 4.2 

### 6.4. SPEND  TRIGGER, SELECT ARCHETYPE
You will then be given one (1) trigger by your Referee (REF) to spend. This trigger allows you to unlock your starting archetype package. Be sure to take down all information on your archetype package. 

> Reference Archetypes, p. 4.3 

### 6.5. SELECT BACKGROUND INFO: ANCESTRY, BELIEFS, CULTURE, LANGUAGE(S), AND PERSONAL HISTORY
The next step is to flesh out your character’s background information, which includes ancestry, beliefs, culture, language(s), and personal history. Choose wisely, as they will have serious roleplaying ramifications. 

> Read more on Background starting on p. 5


### 6.6. SELECT BURDENS, FEATS, GIFTS, & SKILLS
Using your archetype starting package and your background information (see above), you are then able to select starting burdens, feats, gifts, and skills. Be sure to record all info associated with each, as they will have an important role to play in future game sessions. 

> See Burdens, Feats, Gifts, & Skills starting on p. 6

### 6.7. ROLL D100 FOR STARTING FINANCES
Once you’ve completed the steps listed above, you will roll for starting finances. This roll is modified according to class and archetype, and it must be agreed to by the Referee (REF).

### 6.8. PURCHASE STARTING EQUIPMENT & POSSESSIONS
Using your starting wealth, purchase initial equipment and possessions. Think wisely here, as they may save your character’s life in the future. 

> See Equipment & Possessions, p. 8

### 6.9. FINALIZE OTHER DETAILS
This is where you fill in other details about your character, double-check all modifiers, and get ready to play.

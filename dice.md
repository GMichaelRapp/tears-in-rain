## 5. Dice
There are four (4) kinds of dice used in **Tears In Rain**. These dice are the standard six-sided die (d6), the ten-sided die (d10), the twenty-sided die (d20), and the hundred-sided die (d100).

The scores produced on a singular d10 range from one (1) to ten (10 or 0). However, please note, there are d10s that come in popular gaming boxsed sets or dice sets that include double digits: e.g., 00, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90. These can be used like a regular d10 by shaving off the extra zero mentally: 00 (0), 10 (1), 20 (2), 30 (3), 40 (4), 50 (5), 60 (6), 70 (7), 80 (8), and 90 (9). These double-digit d10s are best used when rolling a d100 (see below for details).

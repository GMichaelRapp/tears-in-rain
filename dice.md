## 5. Dice
There are four (4) kinds of dice used in **Tears In Rain**. These dice are the standard six-sided die (d6), the ten-sided die (d10), the twenty-sided die (d20), and the hundred-sided die (d100).

### 5.2. Dice Notation
Dice are referred to through their shorthand dice notations: e.g., d10 (ten-sided die) and d100 (a hundred-sided die). The following notations (i.e., shorthands) are used to reference dice in this game:
- d6: six-sided die
- d10: ten-sided die
- d20: twenty-sided die
- d100: hundred-sided die

Notation is further complicated by adding a number before the standard die notation: e.g., 3d6. This means you must roll three (3) six-sided dice together, adding the results. For example, you roll a six (6), a five (5), and a two (2) on the three dice. This means you have rolled a thirteen (13). 

Dice notation can be further complicated by adding, subtracting, dividing, or multiplying on top of the notiations described above: e.g., 2d10-3. Roll two (2) ten-sided dice and subtract three from the result. You might also see d100/2: Roll a d100 and divide the results by two and then round down, as discussed above under **5.1**. 

### 5.3. Rolling a d10
The scores produced on a singular d10 range from one (1) to ten (10 or 0). However, please note, there are d10s that come in popular gaming boxsed sets or dice sets that include double digits: e.g., 00, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90. These can be used like a regular d10 by shaving off the extra zero mentally: 00 (0), 10 (1), 20 (2), 30 (3), 40 (4), 50 (5), 60 (6), 70 (7), 80 (8), and 90 (9). These double-digit d10s are best used when rolling a d100 (see below for details).  

### 5.4. Rolling a d100
This die, comprised of two ten-sided dice, producing results ranging from zero (represented as 00 or 000 on two ten-sided dice) up to ninety-nine (99). 
There are often two kinds of ten-sided dice sold at game shops, online retailers, and elsewhere. A standard ten-sided die has results between 01 and 10 (which is represented as a zero (0) on a single, standard d10). It has become increasingly common in game shop dice sets to see a d10 that has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0, and a second, accompanying d10 with 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 00. A combination of 00 and 0 should still be read as a zero (0) score on a d100. A '0' on a d10 roll is alaways read as ten (10).
